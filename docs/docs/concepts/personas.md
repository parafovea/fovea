# Personas

A persona represents an analyst or analytical perspective in Fovea. Each persona maintains its own ontology while working with shared world objects.

## How Personas Work

When you create a persona, you get a separate set of types: EntityType, EventType, RoleType, and RelationType. These types are specific to your analytical framework. The world objects (Entity, Event, Time, Location) are shared across all personas, but different personas can assign different types to the same objects.

This separation lets multiple analysts work on the same video with different interpretive frameworks. One analyst might classify an object as a "vehicle," while another classifies it as a "threat." Both classifications coexist without conflict.
