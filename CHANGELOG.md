# Changelog

All notable changes to the Fovea project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).

## [0.4.0] - Unreleased

### Changed

#### UI Framework Migration

- Migrated the entire annotation tool frontend from Material UI to shadcn-ui
- Replaced MUI `Box`, `Typography`, `Button`, `Alert`, `Accordion`, `Dialog`, `Menu`, and form primitives with shadcn equivalents
- Switched from Emotion-based theming to Tailwind CSS v4 with a Fovea-specific design-token layer
- Replaced MUI icons with Lucide React icons via a barrel export
- Layout rebuilt around the shadcn sidebar composition pattern with fixed dialog overflow handling
- Updated all component tests for the new shadcn DOM structure, ARIA roles, and named exports

### Removed

- `@mui/material`, `@mui/icons-material`, `@mui/x-*`, `@emotion/react`, and `@emotion/styled` dependencies

## [0.3.0] - Unreleased

### Added

#### Model Service Clean Architecture

- Domain layer with entities, value objects, and exception hierarchy
- Application layer with service interfaces (ports) and use cases
- Infrastructure layer with adapter pattern for all external dependencies
- Dependency injection container with manual factory wiring
- Pydantic StrictBaseModel with plugin for stricter validation
- NumPy-style docstrings across all model service modules
- Contract tests with fake model manager and VLM loader

#### CPU Inference Support

- ONNX Runtime detection loaders (YOLO-World, Florence-2, Grounding DINO)
- llama.cpp LLM loader with GGUF quantization for fast CPU text generation
- llama.cpp VLM loader with GGUF multimodal inference
- SmallVLMLoader for Transformers-based CPU vision models (SmolVLM, Moondream)
- Factory function dispatch for all loader types (detection, LLM, VLM)
- CPU model configurations in models-cpu.yaml with GGUF entries
- llama-cpp-python added to CPU optional dependency group

#### Docker CPU Build

- Automatic installation of CPU extras (onnxruntime, llama-cpp-python) when DEVICE=cpu
- cmake added to builder stage for compiling native extensions
- Model config auto-selection via symlink (models-cpu.yaml for CPU, models.yaml for GPU)

#### Frontend CPU Mode

- Backend config endpoint exposes `models_available` and `cpu_models_available` flags
- Three-state UI: GPU mode, CPU mode with models (info), no models available (error)
- All AI features (detection, summarization, ontology, claims) enabled when CPU models exist
- Replaced binary `isCpuOnly` gating with `modelsDisabled` across all components

### Changed

- Model service restructured from flat module layout to Clean Architecture layers
- Route handlers decomposed into domain-specific modules with DI
- Use cases updated with corrected imports after architecture relocation
- Claims route reads framework from config instead of hardcoding Transformers
- Frontend `ModelConfig` interface extended with `modelsAvailable` and `cpuModelsAvailable`
- ModelSettingsPanel shows CPU mode info banner instead of GPU-required error
- ModelStatusDashboard uses severity-appropriate alerts for CPU mode

### Fixed

- Broken relative imports in use cases after architecture refactoring
- Video module export mismatches (download_video vs download_video_if_needed)
- Claims route hardcoding `LLMFramework.TRANSFORMERS` instead of reading config
- ESLint warnings: missing hook dependencies, unused variables and imports
- Ruff errors: unsorted `__all__` lists, import ordering, deferred import warnings

## [0.2.0] - 2026-04-21

### Added

#### Role-Based Access Control (RBAC)
- CASL authorization engine with permission seed data
- Role-based permission schema (admin, manager, annotator, viewer)
- Row-level authorization on every data route (annotations, summaries, claims, world state, personas, ontology, export, import) using `accessibleBy()` list filters and `subject()`-based instance checks
- Per-model ownership field resolution: `Persona`/`WorldState` use `userId`, `Annotation` uses `createdByUserId`, `VideoSummary`/`Claim`/`UserGroup` use `createdBy`, `Project` uses `ownerUserId`
- Per-user ability cache with explicit invalidation on every membership add, remove, role change, and project deletion
- Admin-editable `/api/admin/permissions` CRUD endpoints for runtime RolePermission management
- Sharing privilege cap: re-shared resources cannot exceed the received permission level
- VideoAccessService wired into all video routes so authenticated users only see videos assigned to their projects; non-existent videos pass through so route validation errors are not masked by 404
- Backfill migration populating `createdByUserId` from legacy `userId` on existing annotations, and `createdBy` on existing summaries and claims from their owning persona's user
- 29 negative RBAC security tests covering cross-tenant IDOR, null-ownership denial, cache invalidation timing, sharing escalation, and admin-only enforcement
- `seedBaselinePermissions()` test helper module for E2E test setup

#### Projects and Groups
- Project entity with membership, ownership, and sharing controls
- Group entity for organizing users into teams
- Backend routes for CRUD operations on projects, groups, and memberships
- Video assignment to projects with access scoping
- Project sharing with configurable permission levels
- User autocomplete for persona and member dialogs

#### Frontend
- Admin panel pages for project and group management
- Frontend stores and TanStack Query hooks for RBAC entities
- Project assignment and sharing dialogs in persona editor
- Member management with role selection

#### Observability
- OTEL tracing spans for RBAC authorization checks
- Prometheus alert rules for permission denied events
- Grafana RBAC monitoring dashboard
- Metrics for group, project, sharing, and video assignment operations

#### Testing
- Unit and integration tests for RBAC, groups, projects, sharing, and video assignments
- Frontend tests for RBAC stores, query hooks, and user management pages

#### Documentation
- User guide for projects and groups workflow
- RBAC architecture and permission model documentation
- API reference for new endpoints

### Changed

- All data-mutating routes now populate `createdByUserId` (annotations) and `createdBy` (summaries, claims, claim relations) from the authenticated session, never from the request body
- All Prisma JSON field handling uses runtime `toJson()` conversion and `Prisma.JsonObject` type guards instead of type assertion casts

## [0.1.7] - 2026-04-15

### Fixed

- Regenerates IDs for cross-user imports whose exports contain no persona lines (for example, users who only create object annotations linked to world entities)
- Remaps array-valued ID reference fields (`entityIds`, `eventIds`) on entity and event collections during cross-user imports
- Remaps `GlossItem.content` for `objectRef`, `annotationRef`, `claimRef`, and instance-level `typeRef` items so claims citing regenerated objects follow their new UUIDs
- Lets cross-user ID regeneration override non-regenerating resolutions (`skip`, `replace`, `merge`) so annotations referencing entities in the same import batch get new IDs

### Added

- Emits a provenance `metadata` line with `exporterUserId` at the start of every full export for reliable cross-user detection
- Emits `userId` on exported object annotations so cross-user detection works for exports that contain no persona lines
- Import dialog now shows a cross-user banner, per-conflict smart defaults, an "apply to all" bulk resolution, and auto-collapses large conflict groups

## [0.1.6] - 2026-03-28

### Fixed

- Generates new UUIDs when importing annotations from a different user even when original IDs are absent from the database

## [0.1.5] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- Fixes object annotation dropdown jitter when creating a second bounding box on a video

## [0.1.4] - 2026-03-10

### Fixed

- Scopes export keyframe and interpolated frame statistics to the authenticated user's annotations

## [0.1.3] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- Skips invalid annotation sequences during export instead of returning 400

## [0.1.2] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- Stabilizes entity dropdown scroll behavior in annotation autocomplete

## [0.1.1] - 2026-03-06

### Fixed

- Scopes annotation export to the authenticated user's personas

## [0.1.0] - 2026-02-27
